# CS2261Final
Final project game for Media Devices and Architecture. Using C++ coding and GBA emulation

I created this game as the final project for my Media Devices and Architecture class. All the art for the game is original and I used
Usenti to make and export it.

All the music and sound effects are also personally edited and exported from Audacity to be compatible with the software.

This is an original game concept: the player must use the left and right arrow keys to maneuver the gun at the bottom of the screen and 
use the A button (key x) to shoot down UFOs while avoiding being shot by the enemy invaders as well. To regain one of their three lives, 
The player must use the B button (key z) to hit a shooting star. The clouds block all ammunition coming from the player as well. Pressing
the up arrow key serves as a cheat to get rid of cloud cover and make winnign the game easier.
